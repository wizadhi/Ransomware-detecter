# Ransomware-detecter
This detecter in written in python.
This works in the method like we preload the ransomeware's hashvalue and we compare the hashvalue with the file we choosen.
If it is ransomeware it gives the message "WARNING: The uploaded file is identified as ransomware!" .
else
It gives "The uploaded file is clean.".
